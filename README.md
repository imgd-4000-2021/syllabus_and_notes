# IMGD 4000 - Technical Game Development II - Spring 2021

Instructor: Charlie Roberts w/ Ralph Sutter (IMGD 4500)

IMGD 4000 will expose students to concepts related to technical development using game engines. Game engines are used in a wide range of fields including games, simulations, and architecture, and are an important part of any developer's toolbox, regardles of whether or not a developer is working on a "game". 

Some topics discussed in this course include:

- Modern game development engines (primarily Unreal) and game engine design patterns  
- Game-specific algorithms (path finding, agent-based AI etc.)  
- Source control / asset management for game engines  

## Learning in the time of COVID-19
This class will be taught entirely online. 

Your first priority in this difficult time should be taking care of yourself, your family, and limiting your risk of contracting / spreading COVID-19 (and get vaccinated!) All individual assignments in this class will come with a recommneded due date that is intended to help keep you on track, *but you are free to turn them in at any point in the course*. Group assignments will have stricter deadlines to try and keep projects on track.

Don't let this class add too muchh more stress to your life; use it as a time to have fun with a powerful game engine building an interactive experience with your talented peers. At the same time, try to remember that you are working on a project as part of a team, and communicate to your teammates what you feel you can reasonably contribute and when you will be able to deliver it. 

## Course Communication / Meetings
Course communication will primarily occur through the course Discord server; please email the instructor directly if you do not have access to this. Zoom meetings will also be announced in Discord. Canvas will solely be used for posting grades to assignments. Lecture notes / materials will be found in this GitHub organization. 

## Prereqs
While there are no formal prerequisites for taking this course, students will ideally be familiar with C++, which will be used extensively but *not taught explicitly* (with some rare exceptions). IMGD 3000 is a great class to familiarize yourself with C++ before taking this course; there are also various courses in Computer Science that teach fundamentals of C/C++ programming.

## Grades
Students will work in teams in combination with members of IMGD 4500 (Aristic Game Development II) to create an interactive experience in Unreal; this project will account for the bulk of your grade. There will also be two separate assignments using Unreal that will be completed indvidually; these are designed to ensure that every member of the class has fundamental competency using the Unreal Engine.

### Assignments (30% Total)
For the additional assignments in this class, you must complete one of the two programming assignments (Agent-based simulation or Pathfinding / A*) and then one other choice from the following list:  

Assignment 1: Agent-based simulation - 15%  
Assignment 2: Pathfinding - 15%  
In-class tutorial on a development concept in Unreal - 15%  

If you'd really like to focus on C++ in Unreal, completing both programming assignments is great!

### Final Group Project (65% Total)
Initial Design Document - 5%  
Website for project - 15%  
Midterm Code Review - 5%  
Alpha Presentation - 20%  
Beta Presentation - 25%  

## Final Project
The final project will be an interactive experience created using Unreal, coded in a mix of C++ and Blueprints. Students will work in teams of three developers + two artists on this project, and, generally speaking, the final grade for the project will be shared by all team members. There are numerous milestones for this final project (see above) and each milestone will be accompanied by a document detailing what is expected and what the rubric for grading it will be. 

## Academic Integrity

The goal of this class is to both create aesthetically interesting content and understand the code used to create it. In order to understand the code and Unreal more generally, you need to author it yourself; this is particularly the goal of the two individual assignments. That said, there are many ways in which you can assist others without giving them all required code for an assignment. Providing low-level implemetation details (small code fragments that contribute to, but don't complete on their own, major portions of assignments) is welcomed.
